Requires esp-open-rtos from https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos

Try the "http_get" example in the rtos distribution to make sure everything is set up properly.

Connect serial interface cable (FTDI cable) to RX and TX.

In Makefile.inc, set the following:

  RTOS_PATH (path to the rtos installation)
  ESPPORT (path to serial interface to esp8266 module)

Power up the module with GPIO0 pulled low to put it in programming mode.

Then "make PROBE_HOST=esp8266 flash" should build and install the firmware.
